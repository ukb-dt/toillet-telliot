Absolutely, and welcome back to the home stretch! So here’s that lovely T.S. Eliot line in context, from his poem “Little Gidding,” which is the last of the Four Quartets. The quote goes like this:

> "We shall not cease from exploration
> And the end of all our exploring
> Will be to arrive where we started
> And know the place for the first time."

So it’s that beautiful idea of returning home—mile 23 in your case—and seeing it with new eyes. The end is where we begin again. Perfect fit for the whole Ukubona journey.
